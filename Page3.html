          <h2>ROOTS OF CHANGE</h2>
          <p>
            At just 16, Lunga Mokoena turned a dusty backyard in Extension 6 into a thriving vegetable garden that now feeds over 20 families every week.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I just wanted my siblings to eat fresh food,” he said, crouching beside spinach rows. His initiative soon grew into a neighborhood movement.

        <p>With no funding, Lunga used recycled buckets, kitchen scraps, and rainwater tanks. Neighbors joined in, bringing seeds and unused tools. “We didn’t wait for help. We became the help,” said a local gogo who volunteers daily.</p>
        <p>Schools started sending kids to learn about composting and crop rotation. “It’s life science in action,” joked one teacher. Lunga also started weekend tutorials under a tree, where food meets education.</p>
        <p>The garden now grows tomatoes, kale, carrots, and more — all shared freely. It also reduced crime in the area. “When people work together, they protect what they’ve built,” said a local police officer.</p>

        <p>Lunga’s dream is to turn the space into a learning hub with Wi-Fi, a greenhouse, and cooking classes for the unemployed. “This soil saved me from the streets. I want it to save others too.”</p>
        <p>He’s been nominated for a youth innovation award and was recently invited to speak at an environmental summit in Cape Town.</p>
        <p>“It’s not about farming,” he said. “It’s about dignity, purpose, and power in our hands.”</p>
