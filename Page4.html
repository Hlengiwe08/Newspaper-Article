          <h2>WARM MEALS, WARM HEARTS</h2>
          <p>
            Every morning at sunrise, Mama Dora stirs a giant pot outside her shack in Orange Farm. For the past 8 years, she has fed dozens of children before school — no charge, no questions asked.

            “Hunger doesn’t wait for payday,” she says, ladling out bowls of pap and beans with the grace of a queen.

        <p>What started with a single pot and leftover vegetables grew into a full-fledged soup kitchen. Locals began contributing oil, maize meal, and even plastic chairs. A carpenter built benches. A local farmer donates fresh produce every Thursday.</p>
        <p>“She makes us feel seen,” says Busi, 12, who walks 2km every day to eat at Mama Dora’s. “Even when my stomach is empty, I know someone cares.”</p>
        <p>The kitchen now operates 6 days a week and offers storytelling sessions while children eat. Volunteers also help with homework under a makeshift gazebo.</p>

        <p>During lockdown, Mama Dora defied curfews to deliver food parcels. “We were scared, but kids can’t eat fear,” she said. Her courage inspired others to form smaller kitchens across the township.</p>
        <p>She’s since been awarded a municipal medal for service and was featured on national television.</p>
        <p>Her wish? “A real kitchen with a roof. And maybe a little fridge for the leftovers.”</p>
