          <h2>SCRAP TO SPARK</h2>
          <p>
            In a Limpopo village where candles were a nightly norm, 17-year-old Sipho Nkosi built a mini power grid using salvaged phone parts and car batteries.

          <p>
            “Electricity felt like magic. I wanted to learn the trick,” he said, surrounded by blinking lights in his family's hut.

        <p>Sipho’s journey began with a broken radio and curiosity. He watched YouTube videos offline, scavenged junkyards, and taught himself basic circuitry. “I blew up a few wires, but I never stopped,” he said, laughing.</p>
        <p>He now powers six homes with homemade solar panels, old batteries, and a basic control box made from melted plastic and wires.</p>
        <p>His system supports lightbulbs, a few chargers, and even a small fan. “It’s not Eskom, but we’re not in the dark,” his grandmother said proudly.</p>

        <p>Sipho mentors other teens now, running weekend workshops under a tree. A local NGO has offered him a bursary to study electrical engineering next year.</p>
        <p>“My dream is to light up the whole province — no more studying by candlelight,” he said.</p>
        <p>The project has gained media attention, with engineers and sponsors visiting to support and expand it. “This boy reminds us what innovation really means,” said one donor.</p>
