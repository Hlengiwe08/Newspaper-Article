          <h2>SIHLE'S STORY</h2>
          <p>
            In a small dusty town tucked beyond the hills of Gauteng, one girl's quiet determination sparked a digital revolution. Sihle Ndlovu, only 17, taught herself how to code using a borrowed smartphone and free online tutorials.

          <p>
            Her passion didn’t go unnoticed. Soon, she began teaching neighborhood kids basic HTML and CSS on weekends under a tree next to her home.

        <p><strong>From humble beginnings</strong>, Sihle’s influence reached far beyond her block. What began as a simple afterschool project transformed into the community’s first coding club. "She made tech feel possible," said one student.</p>
        <p>The club, now called *CodeRoots*, has since helped over 40 teens build websites, apps, and even enter provincial hackathons. Parents noticed a change, too — children were staying off the streets and dreaming bigger.</p>
        <p>Local businesses soon partnered with the initiative, donating laptops and data bundles. Her story caught the attention of a Johannesburg tech firm that offered her a full scholarship to study computer science next year.</p>

        <p>“We had never seen anything like her,” says Mr. Khumalo, her former primary school teacher. “She didn’t just break the mold — she rewrote it.”</p>
        <p>With resilience stitched into every line of code, Sihle continues to inspire young girls in rural areas. Her dream is to return after university and start a formal coding academy for township youth.</p>
        <p>Her message? “You don’t need to be rich to change your world. Just start where you are, with what you have.”</p>
