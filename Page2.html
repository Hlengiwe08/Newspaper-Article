          <h2>COMMUNITY INNOVATION</h2>
          <p>
            In the heart of Diepsloot, a community library found a second life—powered not by books alone, but by the people. What was once a crumbling, overlooked building now operates 24 hours a day thanks to a group of passionate volunteers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transformation began with a single WhatsApp message from a retired teacher: “Let’s give the kids a space to dream again.”

        <p>Within weeks, neighbors donated shelves, lights, and even old encyclopedias. Parents brought food, and students shared their notes. The local hardware store chipped in with solar lights to keep it open after dark.</p>
        <p>The real magic, however, happened at midnight. While the township slept, students from working families came to revise for exams, free from distractions and noise. “It’s the only quiet time I get,” said Sipho, a grade 12 learner who walks 3km to study there nightly.</p>
        <p>The space also offers basic digital literacy workshops. Grandmothers now send emails and children search for science experiments online.</p>

        <p>“We’re rewriting the narrative,” said Thandi, a volunteer librarian. “This isn’t just about books. It’s about dignity.”</p>
        <p>On Saturdays, local poets gather to perform at the ‘Verse & Vibes’ sessions, where rap meets literature in a symphony of hope.</p>
        <p>The initiative has drawn interest from international donors, but the founders insist it will remain people-powered. “This place runs on love,” said Mama Joyce, who hosts the evening tea corner for late-night learners.</p>
